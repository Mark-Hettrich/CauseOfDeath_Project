# CauseOfDeath_Project

Here is the GitHub repository where we stored all of our code.

Please make sure to add the cps_00006.csv file to 'Datasets' -> 'Population Data Merge' locally to ensure that the code works. The file is to large to push on GitHub.

The following listed files are the most essential files for this project. Other files only serve exploratory purposes and do not contain meaningful results.
Important Files and their location:
- Early Analysis:
- Multinomial Model:
- Merging of Population Data:
- Negative Binomial Model
- AFT Model
