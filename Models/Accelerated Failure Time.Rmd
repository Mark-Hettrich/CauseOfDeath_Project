Weibull performs best, however is mathematically equivalent to Proportional Hazard Models thus gives biased estimates. We use the 2nd best alternative: loglogistic.
```{r Best Model}
#compare with AIC
AIC(aft_weibull, weibull, aft_weibull2, aft_model_weibull) #weibull2 is best
AIC(aft_loglogistic, aft_loglogistic2, loglogistic, aft_model_loglogistic) # loglogistic2 is best
