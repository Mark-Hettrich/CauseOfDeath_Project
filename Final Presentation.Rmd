# Research Question
To what extend does socio-economic status, indicated by the highest educational attainment influence mortality patterns across different causes of death?

# Methodology
- Data source: U.S. national mortality statistics, CDC
- Two statistical models developed:
    - Multinomial logistic regression – estimates probability distribution across causes of death
    - Negative Binomial regression – models mortality counts while adjusting for overdispersion


# Explaining our Data and Limitations
- About the Data
 > Provided by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention): https://wonder.cdc.gov
 > Dataset spans from 2018 to 2023
 > Focuses on underlying causes of death
 > Data is pre-grouped and defined according to ICD-10 classification

# Data Focus
- We focus on the top 5 causes of death and total death counts
- Key variables include:
     - Age
     - Sex
     - Education level
- Other Variables we analysed:
     - Years & Months
     - Urbanization

# Limitations
 - Missing population data 
 - Presence of zero values and suppressed values in the dataset

```

#

year_month_plot
```

#
```{r, echo = FALSE}
ages_plot
```

#
```{r, echo = FALSE}
sex_plot
```

# Multinomial Model 
Build a multinomial logistic regression model to assess the relationship between:
  - Sex
  - Education level
  - Sex × Education interaction
  - and the Cause of Death (6 categories; “Others” as reference)
Data & Model Setup
  - Used aggregated data with weights = Deaths to account for population size

# Normal
```{r}
summary(model)
```

# Normal + interaction
```{r}
summary(model_interaction)
```


# Compare
```{r}
logLik(model)             
logLik(model_interaction)  
AIC(model)
AIC(model_interaction)
``` 

- Model 1: Cause ~ Sex + Education
- Model 2: Cause ~ Sex * Education (includes interaction)

Key Results
Model 2 (with interaction) had:
 - Lower AIC → better fit
- All coefficients statistically significant



# Transforming external Micro-Census Data to fit ours
- IPUMS CPS: Why and how we used it:
  - IPUMS CPS = National survey with & individual level Data
    - contains Information on Education
  - Used to estimate education distributions by Age Groups & Sex
  - Merged proportions into CDC mortality data
  - Helped us reconstruct population size by education
  - Helpful for education-focused mortality-rate modeling

# Transforming external Micro-Census Data to fit ours
- Why:
  - Lack of population for Education Groups, when grouped by Age & Sex
- Solution: Merge IPUMS CPS population Data to estimate education structure

# Building the Dataset
- Step 1: Clean CPS Data
  - Recode Education level to fit the ones from CDC
  - Group by Age x Sex x Education
  - Use weights within Dataset to estimate the population

- Step 2: Match with CDC
  - Compare CPS population grouped by Age x Sex with CDC population
  - Adjust each population group to match the CDC Age x Sex population

# Final Data
- Data containing the population for Age x Sex x Education
=> We can now analyse death rates
- 10 Year Age Groups, with 85+ as last Age Group
- Use Ages > 24 to model, to interpret highest educational attainment as socio-economic status


# Negative Binomial Model
