"1. Population and rates are labeled 'Not Applicable' when Autopsy, Place of Death, Education, Industry, Usual Occupation,"
"Weekday or Month are grouped by or limited, due to lack of a valid population. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd-expanded.html#NotApplicableRates."
"2. These items in the results table are not fully selected: Codes for special purposes. The Query Description lists the actual"
"values selected."
"3. The populations used to calculate standard age-adjusted rates are documented here: More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd-expanded.html#2000 Standard Population."
"4. The method used to calculate age-adjusted rates is documented here: More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd-expanded.html#Age-Adjusted Rates."
"5. Deaths for persons of unknown age are included in counts and crude rates, but are not included in age-adjusted rates."
"6. Beginning with the 2018 data, changes have been implemented that affect the counts for ICD-10 cause of death codes O00-O99"
"compared to previous practice. In addition, data for the cause of death codes O00-O99 for 2003 through 2017 reflect differences"
"in information available to individual states and probable errors. Caution should be used in interpreting these data. More"
"information can be found at: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/maternal-mortality/."

"Terrorism involving firearms (homicide). The underlying and multiple cause of death codes for 5 records were corrected in the"
"2019 data. Underlying and multiple cause of death codes for those 5 records were recoded to Assault (homicide) by other and"
"unspecified firearm discharge, ICD-10 code X95. The corrected final death records replaces the data released on December 22,"
"2020."
"8. Connecticut population estimates for 2022 and later years are reported for 9 planning regions as county equivalent areas,"
